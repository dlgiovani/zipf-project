The goal is to create an application that displays the frequency of objects from a collection in an 
easy to understand and visualize way, correlating it to Zipf's observations.

The project is in BETA version yet, and it already shows the frequency of words in text files.
I don't recommend the .exe file, for several reasons, it is better to just execute the .py file.
